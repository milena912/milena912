### Introduction 👋

I have created a Magento module for the specific task given. This module is created and works on the latest Magento version 2.4.4.
A module contains two  RESTful services (POST and GET) that store organizations with relations (parent to child relation), from the given JSON example.

                    ] 

                }, 

                { 

                    "org_name": "Yellow Banana" 

                }, 

                {
